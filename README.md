# Interactive-Card

### Author: Hunter Bernier

## **_Purpose:_**

My first attempt at creating an HTML/CSS/Javascript interactive webpage

- It is not linked to any back-end
- It is just a fun interactive page

## **_Description:_**

My interpretation of a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home) Challenge

- Allows the user to input card information through a form:
  - Card number
  - Cardholder name
  - Card expiration date
  - Card CVC
- Once the submit button is pressed, the information is displayed on the cards on the webpage
- Form validation is also run on the inputs to ensure the user is entering correctly formatted information
  - Error messages will be displayed if the information is inputted incorrectly
  - Validation rules:
    - Must enter information for each input
    - Each input must contain the correct data type
      - i.e. cardholder name needs a first and last name and only letters, card number must contain 16 numbers, etc.
